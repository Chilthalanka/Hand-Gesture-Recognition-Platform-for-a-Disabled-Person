# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Platform-for-a-Disabled-Person
The system automatically detects the hand gestures of a partially paralyzed person. According to the detected gesture, the patient is shown a feedback message on his display screen.

## Steps

	* Patient places his hand on the provided backround region and indicates a number from 1-5, using his hand.
	  Each number is assigned a specific requirement of the patient (eg: 1 - Eat something, 2 - Drink something)
	
	* Algorithm detects the displayed number, and displays a feedback message on the patients screen to indicate that his number was correctly detected.
	
	* Further developments are expected to be done by sending the detected message of the patient to another person who is helping him.
